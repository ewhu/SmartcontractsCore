# SmartcontractsCore: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations on EVM-Compatible Blockchain Networks
## Empowering Trustless Asset Management and Governance Protocols

SmartcontractsCore is an open-source Python framework designed to facilitate the development of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) on EVM-compatible blockchain networks. Our mission is to provide a robust and scalable infrastructure for trustless asset management and governance protocols, enabling secure, transparent, and community-driven decision-making processes.

The SmartcontractsCore framework is built upon the concept of decentralized governance, where stakeholders can participate in the decision-making process through smart contracts. By leveraging EVM-compatible blockchain networks, we enable the creation of trustless, autonomous, and decentralized systems that operate without the need for intermediaries. This approach ensures that asset management and governance protocols are executed with utmost transparency, security, and efficiency.

The framework provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for developers to build, deploy, and manage DAOs on various EVM-compatible blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polkadot. By utilizing SmartcontractsCore, developers can focus on building decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols that empower communities to make collective decisions, manage assets, and shape their own governance models.

### Key Features

* **Modular Architecture**: SmartcontractsCore is designed with a modular architecture, allowing developers to easily integrate and swap out components to adapt to changing requirements and evolving blockchain ecosystems.
* **Multi-Chain Support**: The framework provides seamless support for multiple EVM-compatible blockchain networks, enabling developers to deploy and manage DAOs across various networks.
* **Smart Contract Library**: SmartcontractsCore includes a comprehensive library of battle-tested smart contracts for trustless asset management and governance protocols, ensuring rapid development and deployment of DAOs.
* **Decentralized Governance Engine**: The framework features a decentralized governance engine that enables stakeholders to participate in decision-making processes through secure, on-chain voting mechanisms.
* **Real-Time Event Handling**: SmartcontractsCore provides real-time event handling capabilities, enabling developers to build reactive and responsive dApps that respond to changes in the blockchain state.
* **Extensive APIs and SDKs**: The framework offers extensive APIs and SDKs for seamless integration with web3 libraries, enabling developers to build robust and scalable dApps.
* **Security Audits and Testing**: SmartcontractsCore has undergone rigorous security audits and testing, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the framework.

### Technology Stack

* **Python 3.9**: The framework is built using Python 3.9, allowing developers to leverage the robustness and flexibility of the Python ecosystem.
* **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**: SmartcontractsCore is designed to work with EVM-compatible blockchain networks, providing seamless integration with Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polkadot.
* **Web3.py**: The framework utilizes web3.py, a Python library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, enabling developers to build robust and scalable dApps.
* **Solidity**: SmartcontractsCore includes a comprehensive library of battle-tested smart contracts written in Solidity, the programming language of choice for Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchain networks.

### Installation

To install SmartcontractsCore, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/SmartcontractsCore.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up your environment variables (see Configuration section)
4. Build and deploy your DAO using the SmartcontractsCore framework

### Configuration

To configure SmartcontractsCore, set the following environment variables:

* `NETWORK_PROVIDER`: The URL of your EVM-compatible blockchain network provider (e.g.,Alchemy, Infura, or local node)
* `CHAIN_ID`: The ID of your target blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Binance Smart Chain, or Polkadot)
* `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of your deployed smart contract

### Usage

To use SmartcontractsCore, follow these examples:

* Initialize the framework: `from smartcontracts_core import SmartcontractsCore; sc = SmartcontractsCore()`
* Deploy a DAO: `sc.deploy_dao(MyDAO, [0x..., 0x...])`
* Execute a governance proposal: `sc.execute_proposal(0x..., {proposal_id: 1, vote: True})`
